Traditional bandhani uses natural dyes, but synthetic dyes are also common. The fabric can be dyed multiple times with different colors, with additional tying done between each dye bath to create complex patterns.\n\n5. **Drying and Untying**: \n   - After dyeing, the fabric is allowed to dry completely. Once dry, the threads are carefully removed to reveal the intricate patterns created by the resist-dye technique.\n\n6. **Finishing**: \n   - The fabric is washed to remove excess dye and then ironed to smooth out any creases.
